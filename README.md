# Simple Java Calculator

This project was originally written using Eclipse, but I have migrated it to NetBeans.
This calculator is simple with an easy code to help novices learn how to create a calculator program with Java.

If you use the executable "SimpleJavaCalculator.jar" file and that doesn't work, you can type `java -jar /your_calculator_directory/SimpleJavaCalculator.jar` in your terminal.
